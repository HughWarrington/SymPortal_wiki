SymPortal uses an [API provided as part of the Django module](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial02/#playing-with-the-api) to interact with the SymPortal database.

To start a Python3 shell and connect to your database using Django, you can run the following command from within your SymPortal_framework base directory:
```console
(symportal_python_env) $
