Welcome to the wiki of SymPortal. For a brief introduction to the SymPortal framework please see [here](https://github.com/didillysquat/SymPortal_framework/wiki/The-SymPortal-logic#a-brief-introduction-to-symportal)

### The SymPortal manuscript
The manuscript associated with the SymPortal analytical framework will be available very soon.

### Running SymPortal

#### Getting started with a local instance of the SymPortal framework
[Set up](https://github.com/SymPortal/SymPortal_framework/wiki/SymPortal-setup) and [run](https://github.com/SymPortal/SymPortal_framework/wiki/Running-SymPortal) SymPortal. [Query](https://github.com/didillysquat/SymPortal_framework/wiki/Querying-the-SymPortal-database) your new SymPortal database.

#### Submitting data to the remote version of SymPortal hosted at SymPortal.org
Whilst we would very much like to have a 'submit data' button on the webpage which would allow users to upload their data directly via their browser and HTTP, this is currently not feasible due to: 
* the size of data uploads, 
* the user technical expertise required to use some of the more appropriate file transfer protocols, 
* and importantly the need to safeguard against the attack of the website by mass uploads from robots. 
To find a balance between all three of these considerations upload to the remote SymPortal instance is completed via an upload link. To obtain an upload link please email benjamin.hume@kaust.edu.sa. 

By submitting your data to the remote SymPortal instance hosted on SymPortal.org you will be making use of the thousands of samples that have already been run through the SymPortal analytical framework to maximize your power to resolve!
