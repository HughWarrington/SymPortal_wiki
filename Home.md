Welcome to the SymPortal wiki!

For a brief introduction to the SymPortal framework see [here](https://github.com/didillysquat/SymPortal_framework/wiki/The-SymPortal-logic#a-brief-introduction-to-symportal).

### The SymPortal manuscript

The manuscript associated with the SymPortal analytical framework will be available very soon.

### Running SymPortal

#### Getting started with a local instance of the SymPortal framework

* [Set up](https://github.com/SymPortal/SymPortal_framework/wiki/SymPortal-setup) SymPortal on your machine.
* [Run](https://github.com/SymPortal/SymPortal_framework/wiki/Running-SymPortal) a local SymPortal analysis.
* [Query](https://github.com/didillysquat/SymPortal_framework/wiki/Querying-the-SymPortal-database) your new SymPortal database.

#### Submitting data to the remote instance hosted at SymPortal.org

Whilst we would very much like to have a 'submit data' button on the webpage which would allow users to upload their data directly in their browser, this is currently not feasible due to:
* the size of data uploads, 
* the user technical expertise required to use some of the more appropriate file transfer protocols, 
* and importantly the need to safeguard against the attack of the website by mass uploads from robots. 

As a compromise, upload to the remote SymPortal instance is currently achieved via an upload link. To obtain an upload link please email <benjamin.hume@kaust.edu.sa>.

By submitting your data to the central SymPortal.org database you will benefit from the full resolving power of the thousands of samples that have already been analyzed!
